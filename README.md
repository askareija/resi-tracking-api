# Expedition Tracker

Expedition tracker is a web-based expedition package tracking application. This application supports up to 10 types of expedition services in Indonesia such as JNE, POS Indonesia, etc.

But this is only API, which means that maybe you need a client-side application for the UI.

You can take the frontend from the Expedition Tracker application at https://github.com/askareija/resi-tracking
